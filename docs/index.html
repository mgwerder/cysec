                <h3>What is Cysec?</h3>
                <p>Cysec is a open-source, extensible and flexible web application written in Java.</p>
                <p>Its main purpose is to provide a platform for so called "coaches". Coaches are interactive pieces of software that assess a users skill or progress on a certain topic, e.g cyber security. It is developed by the <a href="www.fhnw.ch">University of Applied Science FHNW</a> in Switzerland
                    as part of the <a href="https://www.smesec.eu">SMESEC EU project</a></p>

                <h3>Who are the target groups?</h3>
                <p>Cysec is neither limited to topics like cyber security nor focused on small and medium sized enterprises (SME). The versatile nature of the coaches allows to cover arbitrary topics and is therefore suitable for other parties, such as</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Private persons</li>
                    <li>Associations</li>
                    <li>Companies</li>
                    <li>Governments</li>
                    <li>Non government organizations</li>
                </ul>
                <h3>Data security</h3>
                <p>Cysec does store the answers which were given by the users but of course we are fully compliant to the EUs data security agreement.</p>

                <h3>Specific coaching</h3>
                <p>You can install diverse coaches you want to use.
                    A coach is not a survey tool like monkeysurvey but an intelligent digital assistant. Questions can be enriched with text, images and videos to provide more context information.</p>

                <p>Coaches react on the users input in a variety of different ways: Based on a users input it might include additional questions on the fly to dig deeper into a subject. Coaches are also able to give recommendations on specific questions to guide a user towards best practices.</p>
                
                <p>Gamification is a well-known driver of motivation, therefore Cysec uses scores, grades and achievements as stimulus to motivate users to keep going. The overall progress for a user is also displayed in the skillboard</p>

                <br><br>
                <p>Coaches consist of a set of questions (written in XML notation) and logic programmed in Java. If you want, there's nothing that keeps you from developing your own coach, e.g that . Its fully customizable and easy to use.</p>
